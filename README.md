# High Performance Computing

A general introduction to high performance computing (HPC) taught by Prof. Craig Douglas would be exemplified through the several techniques.

The provided codes are include parallel computing using OpenMP, MPI, OpenACC, and CUDA  as well as memory hierarchies to achieve significant speedups in codes and applications to numerical linear algebra and data sciences.
